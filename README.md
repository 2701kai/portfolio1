Remix
..an attempt to refactor my own code.

What I've learned in my humble beginnings:

- It might be wiser to start anew instead of refactoring own flawed code from decades earlier
- The importance of meaningful commits: I have sometimes barely understood my 'old' code.
- The absolute necessity of structured approach: 'Organize yourself,' break projects into individual tasks or snippets, prioritize, start with the important things first and worry about design later. This way, deadlines can be met more relaxedly. You won't have to hastily create a Card-Section at 4 in the morning on the day of the presentation and load it in an external .css when the rest of the page is styled in SASS.
- Many new insights into my own shortcomings and where there is much room for improvement.
- Gratitude: Many heartfelt thanks to my kind, patient, supportive teachers Giaco and Rami:
